# IMPORTANT NOTE: Much of this file is taken almost-directly from the
#                 FindApr.cmake file in this project. This file is itself taken
#                 from an external source; see comments for details.

# This module helps to find the Subversion packages.
#
# USAGE: to use this module, add the following line to your CMake project:
#   find_package(Svn)
#
# To make linking to Subversion simple, this module defines:
#   * SVN_FOUND       (if false, linking build will fail)
#   * SVN_INCLUDE_DIR (defineswhere to find svn_client.h, etc.)
#   * SVN_LIBS   (binaries for SVN and friends)
#
# Also defined, but not for general use are:
#   * SVN_LIB (where to find the APR library)

# CONFIGURE OUR SEARCH. Specify what we're looking for, and which directories
# we're going to look through to find them.
